## 🚀 Key Differentiators

### What Makes fair-playwright Special?

1. **Hybrid Step API**
   - Inline mode: Quick, simple syntax
   - Declarative mode: Complex flows with explicit success/failure messages
   - Native test.step() support: Works with existing Playwright tests

2. **AI-First Design**
   - Structured markdown output optimized for LLM parsing
   - MAJOR/MINOR hierarchy helps AI understand test flow
   - Context-rich failure reports
   - Artifact linking for screenshots and traces

3. **Progressive Experience**
   - Live terminal updates (not just logs)
   - Smart CI detection
   - Memory efficient for large test suites
   - Respects terminal capabilities

4. **Zero Configuration**
   - Works out of the box with sensible defaults
   - Opt-in customization for advanced users
   - Backward compatible with native Playwright

## 💡 Usage Example

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [['fair-playwright']]
});

// test.spec.ts
await e2e.major('User checkout flow', {
  success: 'Checkout completed',
  failure: 'Checkout failed',
  steps: [
    {
      title: 'Add items to cart',
      success: 'Items added',
      failure: 'Failed to add items',
      action: async () => {
        await page.click('[data-testid="add-to-cart"]');
      }
    },
    {
      title: 'Proceed to payment',
      success: 'Payment page loaded',
      failure: 'Payment page failed',
      action: async () => {
        await page.click('[data-testid="checkout"]');
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

**Output:**
```
Progress: 1/3 tests (33%)
✓ 1 ✗ 0
